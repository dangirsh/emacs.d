A return to a minimal Emacs config


This `init.el' file is made to be used as a fast and standalone minimal config
file but can load some extensions from a given directory by creating symlinks
from `lisp-available-dir' to `lisp-enabled-dir'.

It can also be compiled with `(pl-compile-config)' which generates a standalone
file `.emacs.elc' located in the home directory
