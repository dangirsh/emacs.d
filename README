A return to a minimal Emacs config


This file is made to be used as a fast and standalone minimal config file
but can load some extensions from a given directory by creating symlinks
from `lisp-available-dir' to `lisp-enabled-dir'.

Can be compiled with `(pl-compile-config)' which generates `~/.emacs.elc'
