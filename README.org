My Emacs configuration file

** Introduction

This is yet another step to the biggest lie in the world: a perfect Emacs configuration file.

** Purpose

The idea is to get a single configuration file that will handle:

- File system preparation (create necessary folders and files)
- Packages with the help of macros (wrappers for `package.el')
- Initialization of modes and packages
- Basic configuration
- Set of functions
- Keybindings

** Install

Warning: You might save your existing configuration before installing this one

#+begin_src sh
mkdir -p ~/work/src
git clone https://github.com/pierre-lecocq/emacs.d ~/work/src/emacs.d
cd  ~/work/src/emacs.d
make && make compile && make install
#+end_src
